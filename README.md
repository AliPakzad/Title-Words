# Programming practice: Title-Words


Write a program that prints title words (words that start with capital letters) in a text along with the word's numerical index (The location of the word in the text). If a word with this feature is not found in the text, it will print None in the output. You should not consider the words at the beginning of the sentence as title words. (Words numerical index starts from one)

Numbers are not counted as a title words. The only sign used in the sentence is the comma. Be sure to remove the dot or comma at the end of the word.
